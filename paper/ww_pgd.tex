\begin{abstract}
We introduce \WWPGD\ (WeightWatcher Projected Gradient Descent), a spectral
projection method designed as an add-on to standard gradient-based optimizers,
with primary empirical validation using AdamW.
\WWPGD\ applies structured projections in spectral space at batch or epoch
boundaries using diagnostics computed by the WeightWatcher library.
These projections explicitly drive neural network weight matrices toward the
empirical renormalization group (ERG) fixed point identified in the
Semi-Empirical Theory of (Deep) Learning (SETOL), characterized by a
heavy-tailed spectral exponent $\alpha \approx 2$ and a vanishing trace--log
condition over the spectral tail.
\end{abstract}

\section{Background and Motivation}

Empirical studies have shown that well-trained deep neural networks exhibit
heavy-tailed empirical spectral distributions (ESDs) of their layer-wise weight
correlation matrices
\cite{martin2019heavy, martin2021nature}.
In such models, the tail of the eigenvalue distribution follows an approximate
power law
\begin{equation}
\rho(\lambda) \sim \lambda^{-\alpha},
\end{equation}
with $\alpha$ typically in the range $(2,4)$ and a strong empirical attraction
toward $\alpha \approx 2$.

Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HTSR) theory explains this behavior as an
emergent consequence of stochastic optimization
\cite{martin2019heavy}.
SETOL extends HTSR by identifying a universal empirical renormalization group
(ERG) fixed point governing optimal generalization
\cite{martin2025setol}.
Related phenomena such as grokking and generalization collapse are explained
within the same framework \cite{prakash2025grokking}.

\WWPGD\ is designed to make this fixed point \emph{explicitly reachable} during
training by augmenting standard optimizers with principled spectral projections.

% ------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Weight Matrices and Spectral Normalization}

Let $W \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times M}$ denote a layer weight matrix.
Following standard practice, we define the layer-wise correlation matrix as
\begin{equation}
\boxed{
X \;=\; \frac{1}{N}\, W^{\top} W ,
}
\end{equation}
where $X \in \mathbb{R}^{M \times M}$.

This normalization ensures that $X$ remains well-scaled as the layer width $N$
changes, and corresponds to the usual mean-field normalization of correlation
matrices.

\paragraph{Secondary normalization (WeightWatcher).}
In practice, WeightWatcher applies a second, lightweight normalization to $X$
that rescales its eigenvalues so that their average magnitude is $\mathcal{O}(1)$.
This removes an otherwise arbitrary global scale and makes spectral diagnostics
(such as $\alpha$, $\texttt{num\_pl\_spikes}$, and $\texttt{detX\_num}$) directly
comparable across layers of different sizes.

This second normalization does \emph{not} alter the shape of the spectrum, only
its overall scale, and is essential for defining the ERG trace--log condition
consistently.

All spectral quantities used by \WWPGD\ are computed from the spectrum of this
normalized matrix.

% ------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Critical Conditions from HTSR and SETOL}

HTSR and SETOL identify two complementary critical conditions governing optimal
generalization.

\subsection{HTSR Critical Condition}

\begin{empheq}[box=\fbox]{equation}
\alpha \;\approx\; 2
\end{empheq}

This condition corresponds to scale invariance of the ESD tail and is observed
empirically across architectures, datasets, and training regimes.
Values $\alpha > 2$ correspond to progressively weaker correlations.
By contrast, values $\alpha < 2$ are generally associated with excessive
correlation and overfitting, although such regimes may be useful in specialized
memorization-heavy settings; this remains under investigation.

\subsection{SETOL (ERG) Critical Condition}

Let $\{\lambda_i\}$ denote the normalized eigenvalues of $X$, ordered in
descending magnitude, and let ``tail'' denote the heavy-tailed spectral subspace.

SETOL identifies the ERG fixed point via a vanishing trace--log condition:
\begin{empheq}[box=\fbox]{equation}
\sum_{i \in \text{tail}} \log \lambda_i \;=\; 0 ,
\end{empheq}
or equivalently,
\begin{equation}
\det X_{\text{tail}} = 1 .
\end{equation}

This condition removes the remaining scale degree of freedom in the tail and
defines a true ERG fixed point rather than a marginal flow.

% ------------------------------------------------------------
\section{WeightWatcher Diagnostics and the Midpoint Rule}

At each projection step (performed at batch or epoch boundaries),
\WWPGD\ runs WeightWatcher and extracts two complementary diagnostics for each
layer:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{\texttt{num\_pl\_spikes}}: the number of statistically significant
power-law spikes in the ESD tail.
\item \textbf{\texttt{detX\_num}}: a trace--log based estimate of the effective
tail size, i.e.\ the number of eigenvalues contributing to the ERG constraint.
\end{itemize}

These two quantities define an interval of uncertainty for the true tail size.
\WWPGD\ resolves this uncertainty using a midpoint rule,
\begin{equation}
k_{\text{mid}} =
\left\lfloor
\frac{
\texttt{num\_pl\_spikes} + \texttt{detX\_num}
}{2}
\right\rfloor,
\end{equation}
and defines the spectral tail as the top $k_{\text{mid}}$ eigenvalues.

\paragraph{Exactness at criticality.}
A key prediction of SETOL is that, as $\alpha \to 2$, the two diagnostics converge:
\begin{equation}
\boxed{
\texttt{num\_pl\_spikes} = \texttt{detX\_num}.
}
\end{equation}
Consequently, the midpoint rule becomes exact at the ERG fixed point.

% ------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Projected Gradient Descent on the ERG Manifold}

\WWPGD\ is a projected gradient descent (PGD) method \cite{bertsekas1999nonlinear},
applied in \emph{spectral space} rather than parameter space.

Conceptually, the ERG fixed point defines a \emph{critical manifold} in the space
of spectra: the set of weight matrices whose ESD tails satisfy
\[
\alpha \approx 2,
\qquad
\sum_{i \in \text{tail}} \log \lambda_i = 0.
\]

Standard optimizers do not explicitly enforce these conditions.
\WWPGD\ augments them by projecting weights back toward this manifold during
training.

\subsection{Algorithmic Structure}

Each training iteration consists of two stages:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Base optimizer step.}
A standard optimizer (e.g.\ AdamW) updates the weights using gradient descent:
\[
W \leftarrow W - \eta \nabla_W \mathcal{L}.
\]

\item \textbf{Spectral projection (WW-PGD).}
At prescribed boundaries, the updated weights are projected onto the ERG
constraint set by:
\begin{itemize}
\item computing the SVD of $W$,
\item identifying the spectral tail via the midpoint rule,
\item reshaping the tail eigenvalues toward a power-law template with
target exponent $\alpha \to 2$,
\item retracting to exactly satisfy the trace--log constraint,
\item reconstructing $W$ and blending with the pre-projection weights.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

This projection is implemented via a Cayley-style multiplicative update in
log-eigenvalue space, which preserves positivity and allows controlled movement
along the ERG manifold.

\paragraph{Homotopy behavior.}
Early in training, the projection is softened to avoid disrupting feature
formation.
As training progresses and $\alpha$ approaches $2$, the projection is gradually
hardened, yielding a homotopy toward the ERG fixed point rather than a hard
constraint from initialization.

% ------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Practical Considerations}

Because \WWPGD\ requires spectral decompositions, it is inherently more
computationally expensive than pure gradient descent.
If applied too aggressively or too early, it may slow convergence or interfere
with early representation learning.

For this reason, practical implementations typically include:
\begin{itemize}
\item warmup epochs with no projection,
\item reduced projection frequency (e.g.\ per epoch),
\item softened projections early in training.
\end{itemize}

Performance optimizations and tighter integrations with base optimizers are
active areas of ongoing work.
User feedback and empirical results on a broader range of architectures and
optimizers are strongly encouraged.

% ------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Conclusion}

\WWPGD\ combines empirical spectral diagnostics from WeightWatcher with classical
projected gradient descent to explicitly guide neural networks toward the HTSR
and SETOL ERG fixed point.
By enforcing $\alpha \approx 2$, a vanishing tail trace--log condition, and a
dynamically exact midpoint rule, \WWPGD\ provides a principled mechanism for
controlling spectral geometry during training.
